    <h1 id="about-me">About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is David Green. I am a Computer Science student at
    Franciscan University of Steubenville. I am 22 years old and have
    been programming for some years; despite this, I have never built
    any kind of serious website before 2024.</p>
    <p>This site will serve as a blog for my school projects and
    personal projects, as well as for information that I feel can be
    useful to my fellow classmates and especially my fellow lifelong
    learners.</p>
